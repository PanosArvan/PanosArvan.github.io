    <h2 class="orange_taby">Orange Taby</h2>
    <p class="orange_taby">The orange taby cats are famous for being weird and... "sharing one brain cell" with each other. They are orange in color and most of them are male, almost 70% of them. The female ones tend to be less cuddly and quite unapproachable. </p>
